                    <p class="lead">
                        Compositionality---the fact that the meaning of complex expressions is built up from the
                        meanings of the parts and the structure of the complex---has been argued to be a unique feature
                        of human language, explaining our ability to systematically and productively produce and
                        understand novel utterances. At the same time, this property has played a pivotal role in
                        debates about cognitive architecture and artificial intelligence, with many arguing that
                        standard neural models are fundamentally incapable of the requisite kind of systematic behavior.
                        In this seminar, we will digest a wide range of literature starting with philosophical,
                        linguistic, and cognitive foundations around compositionality, before looking at case studies in
                        nonhuman animals and finally a wide range of recent literature on compositionality in modern
                        language models. Topics include how to measure and detect compositionality, whether natural
                        language and animal communication systems are compositional, how to build neural architectures
                        that exhibit compositionality, compositionality versus generalization more generally, and data
                        augmentation and meta-learning approaches. This will be an active research seminar, where
                        students will work in small groups to execute a prototype research project on a topic of their
                        choosing in consultation with the instructor as well as guide discussions of chosen readings.

                    <h1>Policies</h1>
                    <p class="lead">As a project-oriented, student-driven, seminar-style class, active
                        participation---in the classroom, or in Zoom, as well as on Canvas---is expected.</p>
                    <p>All student work will be carried out in small groups. Groups are free to divide up work as they
                        see fit, but will be required to explain the division of labor with their final project. Except
                        under rare circumstances, every member of a group will receive the same grades.</p>

                    <p>We understand that you may face hard times as we navigate an ever-changing world due to the
                        COVID-19 pandemic and many other world events. If you find yourself struggling with a difficult
                        concept; stressed over politics or health; slowed by monopolistic internet providers; or annoyed
                        at a classmate, please remember that they might feel similar. Maybe not in your very moment, but
                        certainly recently or soon. Some of you may find the return to hybrid teaching conducive to your
                        style of learning and personality. Others may find it stressful or difficult. These are all
                        normal reactions. Please have compassion and empathy, and assume that everyone is doing their
                        best.</p>

                    <p>If you find yourself having trouble learning in class, please do not hesitate to let me know. My
                        goal is to make this class a bright spot in these unprecedented times, and to do whatever we can
                        to promote a healthy learning environment for all.</p>

                    <h2 class="pt-2">A note on time zones</h2>
                    <p>All deadlines and meeting times for this class are in "Pacific Time". Now that we are in Daylight
                        Savings Time, this is UTC-7.</p>

                    <h2 class="pt-2">Communication</h2>
						<p>Any questions concerning course content and logistics should be posted on the Canvas discussion board.  If a more personal issue arises, you can email me personally; include &quot;LING575&quot; in the subject line.  You can expect responses from teaching staff within 24 hours, but only during normal business hours, and excluding weekends.</p>

                    <h2 class="pt-2">Religious Accommodation</h2>
                    <p>Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or
                        significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious
                        activities. The UW's policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation,
                        is available at <a

                            (https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/)</a>.
                        Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the <a

                    <p>Your experience in this class is important to me. If you have already established accommodations
                        with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please communicate your approved accommodations to
                        me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course.</p>
                    <p>If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary health condition or
                        permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to; mental
                        health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), you are
                        welcome to contact DRS at 206-543-8924 or uwdrs@uw.edu or disability.uw.edu. DRS offers
                        resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or
                        temporary health conditions. Reasonable accommodations are established through an interactive
                        process between you, your instructor(s) and DRS. It is the policy and practice of the University
                        of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal
                        and state law.</p>
