                    <p class="lead">
                        Because one of the primary goals of cognitive science has been to reverse-engineer the human mind, there have been periods of intense interaction between the field and engineering developments in related fields like computational linguistics.  The recent development of (large) language models that are capable of producing large quantities of fluent text has (i) re-raised some fundamental questions about what can be learned from data alone, (ii) invited comparisons between language model processing and human language processing, and (iii) enabled new forms of controlled experimentation that can illuminate debates on acquisition.

                        This seminar will be a focused reading group, where we will closely read a body of recent work at the intersection of computational linguistics and cognitive science, centered around questions like: Must certain linguistic biases be innate or can they be learned from data?  When and why are language models good predictors of human linguistic behavior?  A recurring focus will be using <em>language models as model learners</em> through the systematic manipulation of the training data along various axes.

                        participation---in the classroom, or in Zoom, as well as on Canvas---is expected.  Primary course-time will be conducted as a "role-playing reading seminar", where each person reads a paper with a particular role / perspective and uses that to kick off discussion (see <a href="#structure">Course Structure</a> for more information).</p>

                    <p>A final project will be carried out in small groups. Groups are free to divide up work as they
                        see fit, but will be required to explain the division of labor with their final project. Except
                        under rare circumstances, every member of a group will receive the same grades.</p>

                    <p>We understand that you may face hard times as we navigate an ever-changing world due to the
                        COVID-19 pandemic and many other world events. If you find yourself struggling with a difficult
                        concept; stressed over politics or health; slowed by monopolistic internet providers; or annoyed
                        at a classmate, please remember that they might feel similar. Maybe not in your very moment, but
                        certainly recently or soon. Some of you may find the return to hybrid teaching conducive to your
                        style of learning and personality. Others may find it stressful or difficult. These are all
                        normal reactions. Please have compassion and empathy, and assume that everyone is doing their
                        best.</p>

                    <p>If you find yourself having trouble learning in class, please do not hesitate to let me know. My
                        goal is to make this class a bright spot in these unprecedented times, and to do whatever we can
                        to promote a healthy learning environment for all.</p>

                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="pt-2">Communication</h2>
						<p>Any questions concerning course content and logistics should be posted on the Canvas discussion board.  If a more personal issue arises, you can email me personally; include &quot;LING575&quot; in the subject line.  You can expect responses from teaching staff within 24 hours, but only during normal business hours, and excluding weekends.</p>

                    <h2 class="pt-2">Religious Accommodation</h2>
                    <p>Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or
                        significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious
                        activities. The UW's policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation,
                        is available at <a

                    <p>Your experience in this class is important to me. If you have already established accommodations
                        with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please communicate your approved accommodations to
                        me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course.</p>
                    <p>If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary health condition or
                        permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to; mental
                        health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), you are
                        welcome to contact DRS at 206-543-8924 or uwdrs@uw.edu or disability.uw.edu. DRS offers
                        resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or
                        temporary health conditions. Reasonable accommodations are established through an interactive
                        process between you, your instructor(s) and DRS. It is the policy and practice of the University
                        of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal
                        and state law.</p>

                        This course will function as a <a href="https://colinraffel.com/blog/role-playing-seminar.html">role-playing seminar</a>: each week, we will read and discuss two papers as a group. Students will sign up for a role for one of the papers, and will be expected to contribute to the discussion from that perspective. Given the size of the seminar, you will be expected to sign up for a role-playing presentation 4 out of 8 weeks.  The remaining 4 weeks, you will do a written response to one of the papers to help develop critical reading and writing skills. (More information is on Canvas.) The roles:

                            You are attempting to reproduce the main results of the paper, either to confirm its conclusions, or to carry out similar experiments. If you are unable to reproduce the results, try to understand why.  If you are able to, explain what helped the most.  (Note: you are not expected to <em>actually</em> reproduce papers for this class.  Rather, assume that you are trying to, and report on what you find on whether you would be able to.)

                            Based on the current paper, propose an experiment or analysis that would extend the work in a new direction.  This could be a new dataset, a new model, a new evaluation metric, etc.  In particular, try to think of something that is <em>only possible</em> thanks to the current paper, not just a simple extension.

Aim to approach papers charitably, but critically, thinking of how the paper can be made into the best version of itself.

                        Each week, a shared Google Slides deck will be created, and each role-player will be expected to contribute a couple of slides, summarizing their view of the paper from their role.  The deck will be shared with the class, and will be used to guide the discussion of the paper.

                        For the weeks that you are not a role-player, you will write a short (~250 word) response to one of the papers.  These responses should critically engage with the paper by (i) offering a brief summary, (ii) identifying and explaining one strength of the paper, and (iii) identifying and explaning one weakness of the paper.  These responses will be written in a private shared Google Doc and should be completed by the night before the seminar in order to further help stimulate discussion.
                    <p>
                        Non-presenter assignment: for the other paper that week, for which you have not signed up for one of the roles or written a response, you will be asked to (i) contribute an alternative title for the paper and (ii) at least one question about the paper (e.g. something that was confusing, or someothing that you want to hear more about).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because of the length of the seminar meetings, we will take a 10-minute break in the middle of each class, in between the discussion of each paper.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One final note: in the interest of this being a student-led seminar, the reading list below can change based on the interests of the participants and everyone's projects.  If you have a paper that you would like to discuss, please let me know.
