		<h2>Goals</h2>
		<p>Through this assignment you will:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Explore dependency grammars and dependency parsing.</li>
			<li>Investigate transition-based parsing approaches in dependency parsing.</li>
			<li>Gain familiarity with representations of dependency parses.</li>
			<li>Implement the arc-standard oracle to identify and apply the correct transition sequence associated with
				a gold-standard dependency parse.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>Please review the <a href="slides/8_Dependency-Feature-based.pdf" target="_blank">class slides</a>, homework
			slides, and <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/19.pdf" target="_blank">readings in the
				textbook</a> on dependency parsing
			in general and transition-based parsing in particular.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Dependency parsing relies on a transition set which converts the current state of the parse - referred to as
			a "configuration" - into a new state, until some terminal state is reached. &nbsp;The arc-standard paradigm
			employs three transitions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>SHIFT</li>
			<li>(LEFTARC,&lt;label&gt;)</li>
			<li>(RIGHTARC,&lt;label&gt;)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>where &lt;label&gt; is the dependency relation that holds between the head and dependent identified by the
			transition.</p>
		<p>The configuration consists of the <em>stack, buffer, and arcs</em> as discussed in class and in the readings.
			&nbsp;It may be most straightforward to represent these as lists of different types, as in [0 1], [2,3,4],[]
			for a stack with two elements (including ROOT), a buffer with three elements, and (here) an empty set of
			arcs. &nbsp;The elements here refer to the words in the sentence by their indexes. &nbsp;Of course,
			alternate data structures are possible as well.</p>
		<p>You will need to implement a function that applies a specified transition to a given configuration, and have
			code which implements the oracle which determines which transition should be applied to the current
			configuration, while working through each sentence with its accompanying dependency parse.</p>
		<h3>Oracle&nbsp;</h3>
		<p>Create a program to implement the arc-standard oracle and apply it to a set of dependency-parsed sentences.
			Specifically, your program should:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Read in a set of dependency parses of sentences, in a simplified CONLL format.</li>
			<li>For each dependency parse, you program should output:
				<ul>
					<li>to one file, the ordered sequence of transitions corresponding to the parse</li>
					<li>to another file, the dependency arcs corresponding to the application of the above transitions
						to the sentence.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;You are only responsible for implementing the oracle. &nbsp;You do not need to
			train a model based on the oracle transitions.</p>
		<h4>Programming</h4>
		<p>Create a program called hw5_oracle.sh which applies the arc-standard oracle to identify and apply the correct
			sequence of transitions from the dependency parses provided &nbsp;invoked as:<br>hw5_oracle.sh
			&lt;input_dependency_parse_filename&gt; &lt;output_dependency_filename&gt; &lt;output_sequence_filename&gt;
			where,</p>
		<ul>
			<li>&lt;input_dependency_parse_filename&gt; is the name of the file holding the gold-standard dependency
				parses which you will use to derive the transition sequence.</li>
			<li>&lt;output_dependency_filename&gt; is the name of the file to write the resulting dependency arcs
				created by applying the oracle transitions.</li>
			<li>&lt;output_sequence_filename&gt; is the name of the file to write the resulting sequence of transitions
				derived by the arc-standard oracle, which could be used in training a full dependency parser.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Files</h2>
		<p>Please adhere to the naming conventions below:</p>
		<h3>Example and Test Data Files</h3>
		<p>All data and example files may be found in <strong>/dropbox/24-25/571/hw5/</strong>.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>conll.simple</strong>: Set of English dependency parses from the CONLL 2007 shared task, in a
				simplified four column format,<br>
				<ul>
					<li>&lt;index&gt;\t&lt;word&gt;\t&lt;depenendency_relation&gt;\t&lt;head_index&gt;</li>
					<li><strong>ROOT</strong> corresponds to head_index 0</li>
					<li>Blank lines separate parses</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>toy.dep</strong>: Toy set of dependency parses.</li>
			<li><strong>toy.seq</strong>: Oracle sequence of transitions corresponding the dependency parses in
				<strong>toy.dep</strong>.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Submission Files</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>hw5.tar.gz</strong>: Tarball containing:
				<ul>
					<li><strong>hw5_oracle.sh</strong>: Primary program file with language-appropriate extension.</li>
					<li><strong>hw5_dependencies_output.txt</strong>: This file should contain the dependency arcs
						resulting from applying the oracle transitions. &nbsp;They should be in the simplified CONLL
						format described above, and sorted by word index. &nbsp;Correct output should replicate the
						original dependency parse.</li>
					<li><strong>hw5_transitions_output.txt</strong>: The output file with the sequence of transitions
						derived from the original dependency parses, using the arc-standard transition inventory, given
						above.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>readme.{txt|pdf}</strong>: Write-up file
				<ul>
					<li>This file should describe and discuss your work on this assignment. Include problems you came
						across and how (or if) you were able to solve them, any insights, special features, and what you
						learned. Give examples if possible. If you were not able to complete parts of the project,
						discuss what you tried and/or what did not work. This will allow you to receive maximum credit
						for partial work.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Handing in your work</h2>
		<p>All homework should be handed in using the Canvas submission tools.</p>
